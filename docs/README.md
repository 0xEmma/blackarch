What is BlackArch Linux?
------------------------

**BlackArch Linux** is a lightweight expansion to Arch Linux for penetration
testers.

The toolset is distributed as an Arch Linux [unofficial user
repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_User_Repositories)
so you can install BlackArchLinux on top of an existing Arch Linux
installation. Packages may be installed individually or by category.

We also have a live ISO.

<!-- Count tools: pacman -Sgg | grep blackarchlinux | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort -u | wc -l -->
We currently have over 1019 tools in our toolset and the repository is
constantly expanding.

  3. The live ISO comes with an installer (`blackarch-install`). You can use the
