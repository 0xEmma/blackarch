Rules:
    1. Read the Arch Packaging Standards (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Packaging_Standards).
    2. Don't add 'Maintainer' or 'Contributor' comments to PKGBUILD files.
    3. For the sake of consistency, use two-space indentation.

More rules:
    1. If a package is in an official repository,
       1.1. Add the '-blackarch' suffix to its name. If the package is a
            multiplex package, add the suffix to each package function.
       1.2. Put the official package name in the 'conflicts' and 'provides'
            variables.

Tips:
    1. 'yaourt -G <package>' will get a package's PKGBUILD file.
    2. 'scripts/prep-packages' cleans up PKGBUILD files. It can save you some
        time.
