We accept pull requests of all sizes, from tiny typo fixes to new packages.

Steps for contributing:
    1. Fork.
	2. Hack.
	3. Commit.
	4. Push.
	5. Ask us to merge in your changes, preferably through a pull request.

Requests:
    1. Read the Arch Packaging Standards (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Packaging_Standards).
    2. Don't add 'Maintainer' or 'Contributor' comments to PKGBUILD files.
    3. For the sake of consistency, use two-space indentation.

Tips:
    1. 'yaourt -G <package>' will get a package's PKGBUILD file.
    2. 'scripts/prep-packages' cleans up PKGBUILD files. It can save you some
        time.
	 3. We have our own fork of namcap. It checks PKGBUILD files. Use it.
