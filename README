The PKGBUILD file here (will) build a pseudo package that has security tools in
its dependency list. The dependency list is generated from several list files.
The list files are currently in a state of disarray. Hopefully I will be able to
finish the initial lists before 15/05/2013.

This is not the original ArchTrack project. I started this project before I was
aware of ArchTrack's existence. Since ArchTrack appears to be dead, I am
creating an approximately equivalent project with the same name.
